            <!--<p>From Luke Wroblewski's <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1514">Multi-Device Layout Patterns</a>:</p>-->
        <!--<blockquote>
                <p>Another popular pattern starts with a multi-column layout and ends up with a single column layout, dropping columns along the way as screen sizes get narrower. Unlike the Mostly Fluid pattern, the overall size of elements in this layout
                    tend to stay consistent. Adapting to various screen sizes instead relies on stacking columns.</p>
                <p>When and how is each column is stacked at different resolution breakpoints differs for each design, but generally either navigation or content is placed at the top of narrow screens.</p>
