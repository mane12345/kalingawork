        <div class="box light_blue">Mike the Headless Chicken (April 20, 1945 â€“ March 17, 1947), also known as Miracle Mike,[1] was a Wyandotte chicken that lived for 18 months after his head had been cut off. Although the story was thought by many to be a hoax, the bird's owner
            took him to the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah to establish the facts.</div><br><br><br>
        <div class="box green">Once his fame had been established, Mike began a career of touring sideshows in the company of such other creatures as a two-headed baby. He was also photographed for dozens of magazines and papers, and was featured in Time and Life magazines.[3]
            Mike was put on display to the public for an admission cost of 25 cents. At the height of his popularity, the chicken's owner earned US$4,500 per month ($48,300 today) and was valued at $10,000.</div>
